# MicroLoanChain

A blockchain-powered microloan platform that facilitates trust, minimizes operational costs, and ensures fair access to financial services for underserved populations.

## Features

- Apply for microloans with customizable terms
- Store loan terms on Solana blockchain for transparency and security
- Browse and fund available loans
- Manage loan repayments
- Credit score system for borrowers

## Blockchain Integration

The platform uses Solana blockchain to store and retrieve loan terms, ensuring transparency and immutability of loan agreements. The blockchain integration includes:

1. **Storing Loan Terms**: When a borrower applies for a loan, the terms are stored on the Solana blockchain, including:
   - Loan amount
   - Interest rate
   - Repayment period
   - Purpose of the loan

2. **Retrieving Loan Terms**: On the lending page, available loans are fetched from the blockchain, allowing lenders to see the exact terms they'll be funding.

3. **Funding on Blockchain**: When a lender agrees to fund a loan, the transaction is executed on the blockchain, transferring funds to the borrower and updating the loan status.

## Technical Implementation

The project uses:

- Solana blockchain for storing loan terms and handling transactions
- Phantom wallet for connecting to the Solana network
- Anchor framework for Solana program interactions
- React + Next.js for the frontend
- TailwindCSS for styling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
cd MicroLoanChain/client
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the client directory with:
```
VITE_PROGRAM_ID=Transactions11111111111111111111111111111111
VITE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS=<your-platform-wallet-address>
```

4. Run the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

1. Connect your Phantom wallet
2. Apply for a loan as a borrower or browse available loans as a lender
3. Fund loans that meet your criteria
4. Track repayments and loan status

## Smart Contract

The Solana smart contract handles:
- Creating loan accounts
- Funding loans
- Processing repayments
- Managing defaults
- Updating borrower credit scores
